### { Football Loving A**hole Beerdrinkers }

#### **About:**
This is a blog for college football enthusiasts who also like craft beer.  Merritt Schumann II is the founding father of this group and has used his ingenious Excel skills over the years to organize his own approach to a fantasy football league where winners are awarded.... you guessed it... their choice of beer.  Yes; he usually wins.  I plead the 5th regarding how much I help him enjoy the spoils.

The original members of this group have enjoyed years of talking smack with one another face-to-face and in print, **mostly** regarding their affinity for certain college football teams, players, coaches, conferences.  There is evidence to prove it, and this site is an effort to bring the smack to light.

#### **Technology Used:**
 - HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, NodeJS, Express, Bcrypt, Bootstrap, Trello

#### **Design Inspiration:**
The design of this application is inspired by Girl Gang, which I contributed to in a collaborative project while attending General Assembly's WDI Immersive Boot Camp.  Girl Gang live site: http://girl-gang.herokuapp.com/

 - [ ] Collapse nav at a smaller breakpoint

 - [ ] add animation/transition effect to posts when mouse hovers over them

 - [ ] Center FLABie profile card row when it is at a smaller screen sizes

 - [ ] Add dismissible alert to each section which activates when user that is not logged in tries to access data

 - [x] address issue where user looks at another user's profile that when they go back to look at their own they can see the hidden tab that allows them to update their profile (tab doesn't come back after they visit others' profiles) ===>this is fixed in the flabbie controller & can be looked at when updated the other controllers

 - [ ] Comments are rendered to page when post button is clicked (all models)

 - [ ] Clean up unnecessary code present which became obsolete when BS4 redesign occurred.

 - [ ] Update smack model to include url
