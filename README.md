### { Football Loving A**hole Beerdrinkers }

#### **About:**
This is a blog for college football enthusiasts who also like craft beer.  Merritt Schumann II is the founding father of this group and has used his ingenious Excel skills over the years to organize his own approach to a fantasy football league where winners are awarded.... you guessed it... their choice of beer.  Yes; he usually wins.  I plead the 5th regarding how much I help him enjoy the spoils.

The original members of this group have enjoyed years of talking smack with one another face-to-face and in print, **mostly** regarding their affinity for certain college football teams, players, coaches, conferences.  There is evidence to prove it, and this site is an effort to bring the smack to light.

#### **Design Inspiration:**
The design of this application is inspired by Girl Gang, which I contributed to in a collaborative project while attending General Assembly's WDI Immersive Boot Camp.  Girl Gang live site: http://girl-gang.herokuapp.com/
